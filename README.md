Hi there!
This is a full stack project, here is the frontend repo (built with React): https://github.com/Gatchan1/Virtual_Pet-Frontend

This backend is built using Spring Web MVC and it's main learning goal was the **authentication** with role based authorization.
The database used is **MongoDB**.

The idea of the app is that the user would create a user account, and once logged in they can create their own **virtual pets**, 
which they'll have to take care of through feeding and playing with them, and also one can change the pet's accessories and/or change to a different location.

This is how the frontend looks, when you check in a specific pet.

This would be the database schema diagram I built:\

When a pet is created, it comes with a "unique" personality: random preferences regarding accessories and locations.
Also their level of happiness and energy decreases automatically as time passes by, but when sleeping they regain energy.

This was one of the two final projects made for my Java & Spring Framework bootcamp (@It Academy, Barcelona, 2024).  \
I had a lot of fun building it! âœ¨
